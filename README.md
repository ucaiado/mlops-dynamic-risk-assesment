Dyamic Risk Assesment System
================


This project is part of the [ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821)
 program, from Udacity. I set up processes and scripts to re-train, re-deploy,
 monitor, and report on an ML model that estimates the attrition risk of each
 client from a company

I deployed the model using the Flask package, and some API tests were also
 implemented.
